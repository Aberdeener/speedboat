# Rowboat

Rowboat is a public Discord bot focused on moderation and assiting in running larger communities. Rowboat is extremely extendable and configurable, and is built around a YAML configuration file similar to Reddit's [AutoModerator](https://github.com/Deimos/AutoModerator). For more information on setting up and configuring Rowboat, please visit the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/b1naryth1ef/rowboat/wiki/Getting-Started)
